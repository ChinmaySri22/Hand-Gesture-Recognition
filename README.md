# Hand Gesture Recognition
Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition repository! Our project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify hand gestures like palm, fist, and thumbs up. With high accuracy on diverse gestures, our model is suitable for real-time applications.
add app.py to a new project in pycharm and add the model file with the app file in the .venv folder.
